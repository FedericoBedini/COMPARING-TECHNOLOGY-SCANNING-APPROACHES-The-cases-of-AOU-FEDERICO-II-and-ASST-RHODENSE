The report aims to dissect the technology scanning practices in two Italian hospitals – AOU Federico II in Naples and ASST Rhodense in Garbagnate, Milan – by mapping information sources, evaluation workflows, and organizational barriers. Drawing on structured interviews with clinical engineers Tommaso Cerciello (from AOU Federico II) and Antonio Scarso (from ASST Rhodense), a comparative analysis was conducted to identify critical gaps, benchmark best practices and propose targeted recommendations for strengthening early detection of emerging healthcare technologies and seamlessly integrating scanning outputs into each institution’s strategic investment and governance processes.
